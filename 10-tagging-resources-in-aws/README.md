# Instructions

1. Take the contents of `stack.json` and use it to create a CloudFormation template in the AWS Console.
2. Use the CloudFormation console to add a tag with the key of `app` and the value of `demo10`.
3. Then visit the Systems Manager and look for your resources with the Resource Groups section.
4. Create a resource group based on the tag you used earlier. 
5. After finding your resources and reviewing them in the resource group, create an S3 bucket and add the same tag of `app` and `demo10`
5. Review how the resource group now changes to include the S3 bucket.
